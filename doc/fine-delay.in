@top Introduction

This is the user manual for the device driver developed for the
``fmc-delay-1ns-4cha'' board developed on @code{ohwr.org}.  Please
note that the ohwr project is misnamed as @code{fmc-delay-1ns-8cha};
thus the web references include this wrong naming and it's not a typo
in the documentation.

This driver depends on two other drivers, as well as the Linux kernel.
Also, it must talk to a specific FPGA binary file running in the carrier
card.

@section Gateware Dependencies

This driver has been developed from the FPGA binary included in the
package as @code{binaries/spec_top.bin}.  This can also be downloaded
from the @i{Files} tab of the hardware project:
@code{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-delay-1ns-8cha/files} (direct
link:
@code{http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/1179/spec_top.bin}.

If the gateware is updated, I'll take care to always include in this
package the exact binary the software is developed and verified
against.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Gateware Installation
@section Gateware Installation

To install the FPGA image in the target system, please follow the
instruction in the documentation of @i{spec-sw}.  To summarize, you'll
need to place the @code{.bin} file, properly renamed, in
@i{/lib/firmware}.

If you have several @i{fine-delay} cards in the same host, you can
install several copies of the binary, renamed to match the bus and
slot number of the various SPEC cards, or you can use the default
filename if there are no other SPEC cards (i.e. cards hosting
something else than the @i{fine-delay} module).

@c ==========================================================================
@node Software Dependencies
@section Software Dependencies

The kernel I used during development is version 2.6.32, because this
is the one where installed boards are going to run first.  

The driver, then is based on the ZIO framework, available from
@code{ohw.org}. The version being used during development is FIXME.
Similarly, this is a sub-module for the SPEC board, and thus relies
on code from the @i{spec-sw} package, again from @code{ohwr.org}.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Software Installation
@section Software Installation

First of all, please note that you need to define the following
environment variables to be able to compile this driver. All of
them are assumed to be already set when running the commands shown.

@table @code
@item LINUX

	The top-level directory of the Linux kernel you are compiling
        against. This document assumes it is already set.

@item ZIO

	The top-level directory of the ZIO repository checkout.

@item SPEC_SW

	The top-level directory of the @i{spec-sw} repository checkout.

@end table

To install ZIO you should download it and install the branch called
``for-linux-2.6.32'' (this is the only kernel version this
driver has been tested against so far).

The commands here are reported without prompt for easy cut-and-paste,
and the exact version number is used in the checkout command in order
to ensure you are running the same version that has been used during
development.  We plan to place a permanent tag in the ZIO repository
when this driver is completed.

@example
   test -d zio/.git || git clone git://ohwr.org/misc/zio.git
   cd zio
   export ZIO=$(/bin/pwd)
   git checkout zio-beta3-117-g97387e8 || \
       git checkout origin/for-linux-2.6.32
   make
   sudo make modules_install
@end example

@b{Warning:} the commit-ID above is volatile until this driver is
finalized, that's why the command above retrieves the @i{current}
branch @code{for-linux-2.6.32} if the first checkout fails.


The procedure for @i{spec-sw} is similar, but the master branch will
work in this case. Again, the command shows the exact commit
identifier.

@example
   test -d spec-sw/.git || \
       git clone git://ohwr.org/fmc-projects/spec/spec-sw.git
   cd spec-sw
   export SPEC_SW=$(/bin/pwd)
   git checkout 8be5e1b || 
       git checkout origin/for-linux-2.6.32
   cd kernel
   make
   sudo make modules_install
@end example

@b{Warning:} the commit-ID above is volatile until this driver is
finalized, that's why the command above retrieves the @i{current}
branch @code{for-linux-2.6.32} if the first checkout fails.
@c FIXME: the commit identifiers.

Finally, you need to compile and install this driver, using the following
commands, from the @i{master} branch:

@example
   make
   sudo make modules_install
@end example

At this point all the software modules are ready to be loaded.
Actually, the right set sill be auto-loaded when you @i{modprobe} for
@code{spec-fine-delay} if you installed everything.

This is an example of the kernel messages you'll get back:

@smallexample

@chapter Known bugs and missing features

This package is still work in progress, and unfortunately the same
applies to the packages it depends on.  The current package set has
the following known issues exposed by @i{fine-delay}:

@itemize @bullet

@item The auto-loading of @i{spec} submodules is not really working:
the @i{modprobe} command will be stuck sleeping if you try to use it.
Run `@code{insmod spec-fine-delay}'' (or @i{modprobe} by hand instead.

@end itemize

Not all features are there, and the package currently lacks these features
over what hardware allows:

@itemize @bullet

@item Everything. Let's be honest: the driver does nothing at this point.

@item EEPROM support. The driver uses default calibration settings

@c ==========================================================================
@node Wrong FPGA Image
@section Wrong FPGA Image


Thanks to Tomasz, the @i{fine-delay} FPGA binary has a magic number at
a magic address, so the driver can detect if the @i{spec} includes no
gateware or a different binary image.

In this case, a message like the following one is reported:

@example
   fd_probe: card at 0002:0000 has wrong gateware
@end example

If this happens, please put the binary image in @i{/lib/firmware}
where the spec driver can find it. In my case the file name is
@code{spec-B0002.bin} (refer to @i{spec-sw} documentation for details.
